                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Pizza Toppings
            <ul>    
                <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
                <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
                <li>¼ cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
                <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


    <h2>Method</h2>  
        <h3>Step 1</h3><p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3><p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3><p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3><p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>
