    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <p>Potato Filling
        <ul>    
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cups cold mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>For the dough
        <ul>    
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h2>Method</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3><p>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3><p>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream mixture until dough comes together.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3><p>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until firm and smooth.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3><p>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful of potato filling into the center of each round.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3><p>Moisten edges with water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining dough half with sauerkraut filling.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</p>
        <h3>Step 7</h3><p>Enjoy!</p>
